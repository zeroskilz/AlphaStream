# This Application uses HTML/CSS MySQL and PHP
###AlphaStream was a website i first created when I was learning web-development
### This Application does not use prepared statements for all its SQL
### Queries So that means It is Vulnerable to SQL Injection have fun and fix it if you like 
### another thing is that i didnt sanatize the user input but used
# POST REQUESTS FOR THE FORMS so if youd like to try to exploit the
# THE XSS vulnerabilities try it look for 
## SSI and CSRF vulnerabilities  and try and exploit them and if you
## find them before i do then add an issue and fix it or I or someone
## else will
## if you need some references I will be uploading my simple scripts
# for a vulnerable web application and the forgeries ive made to
# exploit a the csrf vulnerabilities using  obfuscation and malicious
#links

### other than that I have another website that I made that should be
### vulnerable a bit even though it uses php prepared statements it doesnt
### use it in all of the php/mysql applications so bug fixes there the
### website never launched to broke for that and at the rate i programmed
## it and didnt program for security all user info would have been
## compromised but then again the website was supposed to be for
## anonymous users and not to have real user info and would not profit
## from your data unlike some websites i wont say coughhh (facebook,
## conical/amazon, and all those other marketers with there invasive
#SUPER COOKIES) hahmmm well thats all fro this readme kinda ranted but
#then again thats my style :-)
